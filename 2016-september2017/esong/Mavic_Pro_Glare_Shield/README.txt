# Summary

This is a shield for the DJI Mavic Pro camera, it is mostly designed for reducing sun glare while taking pictures/video but can also help with wind causing shaking in the gimbal and also can protect the camera/gimbal assembly in a small crash by dampening the hit the camera would normally take.

Unlike other shields I have seen this one will allow the camera to be tilted up at least partially without interfering.  This design was heavily inspired by the sun shield by @leenanj (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2004452) but this was designed from scratch using OpenScad and using the original gimbal cover for measurements/design.

UPDATE 1/5/2017 - Added v2 shield!  Improved protection by closing bottom of gimbal opening, Improved camera view area to be more centered with camera (mostly for asthetics), other minor adjustments.  I have still not been able to fly due to weather but this update fixes some minor issues I noticed in the original, i am leaving v1 for those that prefer it.  I have also uploaded the OpenScad code to Github, feel free to fork the repo and submit any improvements you feel may be beneficial... https://github.com/motley74/MavicGlareShield

UPDATE 1/7/2017 - Added v3 shield!  Improved the lower connector tab to be more secure.  Also, here is a YouTube video showing my Mavic doing some hard turns/stops and pointing the camera up with this installed.  https://youtu.be/kddjNvtIN2E

UPDATE 1/12/2017 - Added v4 shield and removed v2 and v3!  I have added a v4 shield which has a couple of minor adjustments for fit and should have a slightly thicker dome.  I am trying to keep the dome thin for weight as well as I would prefer the dome break in the event of a crash which would hopefully cushion the shock to the gimbal without putting to much pressure on the rest of the aircraft.  I think that v4 should be my last update to this thing but please let me know if you find any issues with it.

UPDATE 1/21/2017 - Added v5 shield!  I added v5 shield but will leave v1 and v4 since some including myself have had success with them.  I recommending using v5 as I feel it has the best fit as well as a better lower connector.  Thanks to @jason_lane for his feedback about the lower connector working better once broken in a specific spot, I have implemented that but this means that a small amount of support will be needed in the lower connector area, this still probably uses slightly less plastic than the piece that supported it before while also improving the connector.  As usual any feedback is welcome.

UPDATE 3/23/2017 - At the request of a user I have added my first version of a full replacement shield.  It is cut off on the bottom to give the part a base to print on and not require any supports but I may experiment with not cutting as much off the bottom as the current version.  The file called MavicGimbalShield.stl is the full shield version without camera view cutout.

Supports are required under the lower rear connector tab.  Supports under the front of hood may be necessary depending on your printer, didn't need them on mine and it came out fine.
