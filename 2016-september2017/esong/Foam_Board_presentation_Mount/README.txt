# Summary

This is a piece I needed to fill the small gaps in an enclosure I am working on for my 3D printer. It was suggested that others may find this useful to mount foam board (5.6mm thick) to a wall or other surfaces. I have included .stl files for both the mount with holes for screwing to a wall, and a solid piece in case you are working on something similar to me.
